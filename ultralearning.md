# Ultralearning

Author: Scott H. Young

## Chapter one

The book starts with the author describing his MIT challenge. He then introduces a few "superlearners": the polyglot Benny Lewis, the engineer Roger Craig who won a large sum of money at Jeopardy, Eric Barone who, entirely on his own, developed a successful video game.

## Chapter two: why ultralearning matters

The following (partial) definition of Ultralearning is provided:

> ULTRALEARNING: a strategy for acquiring skills and knowledge that is both self-directed and intense.

The author does not clarify in what way Ultralearning is a strategy, but observes that strategies are good for some things, and less good for others.

Ultralearning is self-directed in the sense that the learner is in the driver seat. He or she decides **what** to learn and what to ignore, **why**, and *how*.

Ultralearning is **intense**, in the sense that the learner tries hard to maximize effectiveness. Roger Craig used data analysis and engineering principles to maximize his chances of winning. It is also **fearless**: you learn by doing, and to do so, you must go *way* out of your comfort zone.

Most people prefer a slow, mediocre form of learning to this fast, intense way. Many of those who try, give up after a while. On the other hand, succeeding in an Ultralearning challenge brings a rare form of happiness: the happiness of overcoming our own limiting beliefs. We discover that we are capable of something that seemed utterly impossible, that we have a power we didn't imagine we had.

One of the reasons Ultralearning is valuable in today's world is the "average is over" principle. Ultra-specialization and extreme competitiveness are the rule. Many low-skills jobs are moved to cheaper countries. Interestingly the author mentions the example of Apple: "Designed in California, made in China". Design and management are described as non-transferable jobs. One has to continuously move to higher and higher skill positions (I guess management is such a position, at some point). Technology offers new opportunities for learning. Managing them is not easy.

There are 3 main uses of Ultralearning: accelerating the career you have, transitioning to a new career, cultivating a hidden advantage in a competitive world. There's no doubt that there is a growing demand for people who show they can learn quickly. However, many ultralearners are moved by a vision, by curiosity, by the challenge.

One challenge every ultralearner faces is finding time. There are three ways:

1. New part-time projects. You do it in your free time. It takes longer, and it is more diluted, but the key is the intensity and the determination.
2. Learning sabbaticals. Longer times fully dedicated to this activity.
3. Re-imagining existing learning projects. You integrate Ultralearning into what you are already doing.

## Chapter 3: How to become an ultralearner

This chapter describes how Tristan de Montebello went from a novice to the top 10 of the Toastmaster world championship. While every ultralearner is different, there are some general principles that are detailed in the following chapters. (First) Principles are important because they allow to tackle challenges you have never encountered. In the example of de Montebello finding a mentor, having a tight deadline, internal motivation, constantly pushing oneself outside of one's comfort zone, doing what **scares you the most**. Trying different styles, diversifying your learning.

In the case of public speaking, two interesting insights are

1. Trying a diverse range of styles: angry, comedy, fast, slow, intense, detached
2. "Make me care". We usually care, but why should someone else care?

Most successful ultralearners have extreme work ethics. They are not aiming for a goal. They want to see how far they can go. It is the process that matters, not the product.

The chapter ends listing the 9 principles that are detailed in the following chapters.

## Chapter 4: Principle 1 - Metalearning

The chapter opens with the description of how Dan Everett could learn a remarkable amount of aspects of a completely unknown language by following a systematic approach called the *monolingual fieldwork*. The knowledge of how a language is structured, or of how to understand how it is structured, is also known as *metalinguistic awareness*. Everett's techniques, which he learned from Kenneth Pike, appear in the film "Arrival".

The central theme of the chapter is metalearning, i.e., learning about learning. There are two forms: short-term and long-term metalearning. The short form is what you do before and during learning, and the chapter focuses primarily on this form, dedicating only the last paragraph to long-term meatalearning.

The suggested way to structure short-term metalearning is through a sequence of questions: why, what, how.

The "why" is the reason why one is embarking in an ultralearning effort. There are two main types: instrumental learning and intrinsic learning. Instrumental learning is aimed at gaining a skill that can have a practical purpose. Intrinsic learning is instead based on personal interests, detached from immediate practical applications.

If you are embarking in instrumental learning, it is useful to first verify that the new skill is going to be helpful. The best way is to talk to experts. There are many ways to find experts, in person or online. The author recommends setting short (max. 15 minutes) with them. This can feel uncomfortable, but is very useful.

The "what" is about understanding the "structure of knowledge", and is best
achieved by identifying the following three components: concepts, facts, and
procedures.

- Concepts are the thing one needs to understand deeply and flexibly. Mathematics,
physics, computer science, are all disciplines heavily on the conceptual side.
- Facts are things one needs to memorize. Understanding is obviously still
important, but memorization plays a bigger role. Typical example is law.
- Procedures are things one needs to practice: music, painting, riding a bicycle
are all examples.

Once these three categories  have been filled, the next step is identifying possible bottlenecks and ways to increase efficiency. Concepts are best learned by explaining them to someone else.

The "how" is about how we are going to learn a topic. There are two main ways: benchmarking and the emphasize/exclude method.

Benchmarking consists in understanding what are the common ways the subject is learned. For academic topics, the best approach finding material, courses, syllabi, and other resources that show how the order in which the subject is usually presented.
In conceptual subjects like mathematics, it is usually best to stick to the syllabus. For non-academic topics, the best approach is searching for experts or people who did something similar and learn how they did it.

In the emphasize/exclude method you find a default curriculum and you customize it to your needs. This is harder to do for conceptual topics that are new to you, but is valuable for languages, artistic skills, etc.

The author suggests to dedicate approximately 10% of the time allocated for the ultralearning effort to research. This is a flexible amount, and depends on how much time is allocated to the learning effort. If 100 hours are allocated to learning, count an extra 10 hours for research. Young spent 6 months doing research for the MIT challenge, but that's unusual. Avoid using research as a form of procrastination. Reassess from time to time, as adjustments are almost inevitable. Too much research incurs in the Law of Diminishing Returns.

Finally long-term metalearning is about the knowledge accumulated by undertaking multiple such challenges. It amounts to learning how to learn hard things.
