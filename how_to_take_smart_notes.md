# How to Take Smart Notes

Author: Sonke Ahrens

## Self discipline, willpower, distractions

Self-discipline and self-control more important than intelligence, but willpower is a limited resource which cannot be changed much (what is the evidence about this? David Goggins seems to be a good counterexample).

Distractions: most of them come from our own mind, not from the environment. GTD's "Mind like water". Idea: instead of opposing distractions with willpower, try to redirect them in a judo-like fashion. Turn distractions into advantages (how?). Gamification as a tool (more fun = less distractions).

Willpower available in limited supply. Can be trained, but not much. Rather than increasing willpower, we can find or create environments where less willpower is needed.

### Plans

Not making plans: following a plan requires willpower. We are terrible at predicting time and effort (we *always* underestimate).

You cannot hope to find complexity with complexity. The only antidote to complexity is simplicity (in structure and tool).

### Structured approaches: GTD example

Structured approaches reduce complexity.  GTD as an example of a structured approach: we collect *everything* we plan or want to do, not because we hope to do *everything*, but because it forces us to prioritize. Important distinction: TSN (= Taking Smart Notes) is about insights for writing. GTD is about breaking a complex project with deadlines into small, manageable pieces. The problem GTD solves is relieving your brain from the things you are *not* currently working on and that keep nagging you. Zeigarnik effect: open tasks occupy our short-term memory until they are done, or until we reassure our brains that we know how to retrieve them.

Both GTD and TSN require a holistic perspective: the big picture must be well in sight.

GTD: you trust your system only if you can be sure you will not forget or overlook anything because it is reliably captured in the system.

1. Prioritize, focus on one thing at a time.

2. Know how the different pieces come together to create the big picture.

So, possibly Learning -> TSN, while Projects -> GTD ? Think about this. In your work you need both: you need to understand the structure of the organization (TSN) and you need to move your projects forward (GTD).

Luhmann had two Zettelkästen: one for references and short literature notes and one for the permanent notes, where he collected and generated ideas.

## How to use the Zettelkasten

### How Luhmann used the Zettelkasten:

- When reading something: reference on one face of the card and notes on the other. Requires strong synthesis skills.

- These notes end up in the reference box.

- In the reference notes he *always* re-elaborated what he read, never copying and pasting. Important to make sure you understand. Avoids the illusion of competence. Form of immediate feedback.

- After rereading those notes, he develop and connected ideas and captured them in the main Zettelkasten. One note per idea (should fit in one screen).

- Very important: whenever adding a new note, he would check the existing notes (how? All of them? By category?).

- The Zettelkasten is *not* a personal wikipedia (e.g., just a collection of pages with mutual links).

- Two more topic-specific notes: one with a sorted list of link to other relevant notes (use tags). Second: index with links to one-two notes that served as entry-points to a topic.

- Writing the notes is not the actual work. *Thinking*, understanding, synthesizing, combining, generating ideas is the real work. If you cannot express it in *your own words*, you haven't understood it. Visualization is even better. Good tools do not add more features, they reduce distractions so that one can concentrate on *thinking*.

The value of the Zettelkasten compounds over time. It becomes useful only when it reaches a certain critical mass of notes.

- How to combine/separate topics? Is there really a strong divide between academic writing and project management? In what way? What are the commonalities?

### How to write a paper with the Zettelkasten

Process for writing a paper (how can we modify it for other purposes?)

1. Take fleeting notes, anywhere, at any time. A pocket notepad is best. Review them within a day.

2. Make literature notes, i.e., references and selected non-elaborated ideas (straight from the reading). These notes go into the reference system (this note should go there too). Luhmann used a different box, for us Zotero would be the other box. Luhmann never underlined or wrote in the margins. He wrote literature notes like "on page x is this, on page y is that".

3. Before you forget, ideally on the same day, go back to your notes, think hard about them, synthesize, connect, abstract, and generate ideas, and write them down *very carefully* in the permanent notes.

1. They should be crisply explained, concise, and to the point.

2. Vocalize those ideas first: you explain the idea to an invisible examiner. Only when you are satisfied with your oral explanation, you can refine it and put it in writing.

3. Predict possible criticism and address it.

4. Add your notes to the Zettelkasten. Review the existing notes for connections, and create links. If it's a new line of thought, create an index or an entry point.

5. Develop topics by looking into the Zettelkasten. The chain of ideas are already there.

6. Collect the relevant notes, copy them into an outliner and order them.

7. Turn the outliner + notes into a rough draft.

8. Edit and proofread.

### Organizing your notes

Key point: writing is the only thing that matters. Anything you don't capture is lost. Anything you don't share doesn't exist. Writing is what builds your "visible you", your portfolio.

Studying is not a preparation for research. It *is* research. More in general, should *anything* be a preparation?

Old approach: notes are organized by topic, e.g. in subfolders. Zettelkasten approach: notes are organized by context. The same note can belong to multiple contexts.

Project notes are a separate category. They can be kept in a separate folder, and discarded once the project is completed or dropped. If a project note has a broader relevance, move it to the permanent notes. Project notes are not made to last.

### Feedback and growth mindset

Getting better at what we do is the strongest motivator. The only way to get better at something is getting frequent and reliable feedback. *Seeking feedback and not avoiding it is the first virtue of anyone who wants to grow* (from the work of Carol Dweck). A *growth mindset* is one that actively seeks and welcomes feedback. German is an example: you never try to speak because you don't want to look stupid. This is the opposite of a growth mindset. For this to work, you need a system that gives you feedback frequently and quickly. Solving problems, speaking a foreign language, in brief, testing yourself or allowing others to test you. You need *fast-iterating feedback loops*.

Reading with pen and paper provides feedback (unless you just copy the text). You must think it through, understand it, rephrase it in your own words, visualize it, develop examples and counterexamples, criticize it, and only then, you can write it down. When you reread it, it will be clear if you really understood or not.

### The cost of not paying attention

No matter what you are doing, give it your **undivided attention**. There is a huge cost in not doing this, as you will have to go back to the last point before your attention faded, and restart from there. The more you do this, the higher the cost. Distractions are a huge cost in terms of 1) time, 2) quality, 3) mental health.

Multitasking does not mean being able to do many things at once. It means quickly switching from one context to another. Each switch has an associated cost. The more the switches, the higher the cost.

The **mere-exposure effect**: doing something many times (no matter how poorly) makes us thing that were have become good at it. We confuse familiarity with skill.

There are multiple forms of attention.

- Focused attention: we concentrate all our attention on only one thing. This can last only a short time.

- Sustained focus: the kind of focus used in learning. Less intense than focused attention, but for longer periods.

The right workflow makes it harder to get distracted.

### Perfectionism

Perfectionism is not a virtue. There is a time for drafting ideas and a time for proofreading and refining. Great problem solvers do not spend all their time in sustained or focused attention, but rather alternate between those, and more playful, exploratory forms. Creativity comes from the interplay of a narrow, analytical focus, and a wide-open, playful mind.

Following rules and plans often gets in the ways of making the right (or wrong, which is also important and useful) choices, and therefore learning. The rules are the training wheels for when you are learning to ride a bicycle. Once you are comfortable, you can throw the rules away.

### Building meaningful connections

Memory artists do not have better storage capacity. They have learned techniques to bundle items together in a *meaningful* way. They remember the bundles, not the items. Deep understanding works the same way (think of the YouTube video explaining the hieroglyphs.). It is much easier to remember things we understand than things we don't. This is why you *always* must understand first.

### Ego depletion

Ego depletion is a temporary reduction in the capacity to engage in volitional action caused by prior exercise of volition. Willpower is a limited resource. Try to trick yourself into feeling like you like what you are doing. This is more effective than "pushing through the hardships". Reducing the number of decisions is useful for this.

### Reading with a pen in you hand

> “I would advise you to read with a pen in your hand and enter in a little book short hints of what you feel that is common or that may be useful; for this will be the best method of imprinting such portcullis in your memory.”

>  Benjamin Franklin

Taking notes by hand makes understanding easier than digitally. Makes sense: the greater speed of typing makes it easy to transcribe material without any elaboration. If you are slow, you must synthesize (you must understand first!)

Extracting the core ideas from a text is something we get better at with (deliberate) practice.

### Structuring topics can make learning harder

Actual learning requires understanding and deliberate practice. It *is* demanding. Traditional teaching that structures topics in pre-specified order makes it actually harder to build connections. Example: mechanics and electromagnetisms were like two completely disconnected disciplines, with large gaps in the middle (e.g. black body radiation). Finding connections and analogies between the two was extremely difficult. Great teachers are not afraid to use unconventional ways of structuring their material.

Activities that seem to make learning easier, obtain the opposite result. Conversely, activities that seem to make learning harder (spaced repetition, tests etc), make it easier.

Trying to answer a question *before* we know how to, is an extremely effective technique because:

1. It forces you to think.

2. Even if you get the wrong answer, you will remember both the question and the right answer much more easily than if you didn't try.

In hindsight, my study technique had good and bad parts.

The good: regular attempt to retrieve material from memory, without re-reading. The "boom" and "boom boom" pages were useful.

The bad: everything was crammed right before the exam, and not spread throughout the year, which made everything much harder. I didn't do enough exercises. I tried to do them mechanistically, without really understanding.

### Good readers and bad readers

Good readers read texts with questions in mind. They don't stick to the way the text frames an argument, but question, criticize, test such frame. They can generalize to different contexts, and go beyond the information at hand. Conversely mediocre readers take the proposed frame as a given, and don't dare to challenge it. Mediocre readers also tend to take pieces of information in isolation, instead of placing them in the broader context.

### Thinking without writing

According to Kahneman, the brain is a machine for jumping to conclusions. Relying solely on our brains when it comes to scientific and rational work is deemed to fail. Luhmann states that it is not possible to think clearly and systematically without writing. Today there is widespread agreement on the fact that thinking requires some form of externalization, especially in the form of writing. Side note: how much information would you have access to, if you collected and regularly reviewed all the things you learned?

### Context of a note

How do we decide the context(s) a note belongs to? A possible way is to ask yourself why you are taking that note. How is it useful? What line of thought may it develop?

Having an "external memory" allows us to forget things. This is crucial for the learning process. The example of Solomon Shereshevsky, who could remember everything, but could not get the gist of anything. Forgetting could be a defense mechanism to avoid being constantly overwhelmed by every single memory coming back.

### Understanding: isolated facts vs context - analogies

Learning isolated pieces of information is useless. Learning means linking a piece of information to one or, better, multiple contexts. The analogy between electric charge and fluids in a pipe is an example. The same concepts hold, if under different names and very different circumstances. In so doing, they reinforce each other. Is this an example of the power of thinking by analogy?

Challenge of learning is not remembering but understanding. If we really understand, we will remember, and it will be easier to write down what we learned using our own examples and analogies. Example of learning the difference between arteries and veins.

The Zettelkasten's purpose is to help thinking, not to be complete. Don't turn it into a personal Wikipedia. The goal is not to collect the knowledge about a topic that is *useful* to you, not *all* the knowledge.

The focus is on *ideas* not on *notions*.

Personal comment: this is a tricky point. What am I trying to achieve with the Zettelkasten? The first temptation is to use it to store *knowledge, i.e.*, notions I find in books, papers, blogs, videos and so on. This will quickly become another notion-dump, so, this is not the right approach. Two key words, here:

1. Elaboration: accumulating notions is useless if you don't a) understand and b) connect them.

2. Useful. Is what I'm reading useful? For what? Can I make it useful? How?

### The index card

It contains just a link to one or two entry points, not the full list of cards, which would be pointless. Again, the focus is not on completeness. The goal here is to have a starting point. The sequence of notes will do the rest. If we really need an overview of a topic, this can be a (or the) note the index is pointing to. What would it look like? Say our topic is "Taking Smart Notes". You can have an entry-point note "Taking Smart Notes" with tag `smart_notes` that gives a quick summary to the topic. The note will be short, but still it will contain links to notes diving deeper into subtopics.

### Keywords

Choose keywords (tags) carefully. For what purpose do you need them? The purpose defines the keywords. Not the other way around.

Question: is the Zettelkasten suitable for, say, learning a programming language? Is it actually a learning tool? If not, what is a good alternative?

###  Flashcards

Zettlekasten vs flashcards. Flashcards are not, or less elaborated than Smart Notes, and they operate in isolation. There is no latticework of flashcards one can leverage.

### Mental Models

Mental models. [In this talk](https://fs.blog/great-talks/a-lesson-on-worldly-wisdom/) Charlie Munger recommends looking for the most powerful concepts in every discipline, understand them so deeply that they become part of our own thinking process. It is important to learn from experience, but it is more effective to learn from the experience of others.

### Creativity, Intuition, abstractions, counterfactuals

Creativity and intuition. It's not a flash of genius, but the result of spending a lot of time on a problem.

The importance of abstractions. Example of engineers who find creative solutions to practical problems by means of abstraction. The biggest obstacle to coming up with new ideas is breaking with old habits. **Gamification**: for any given problem, try to imagine the craziest, most unorthodox, improbably, irreverent, undisciplined way to do it. When we read we must resist the urge to jump to conclusion. We must revise and double check that what we understood is what the author is actually saying. Difference between seeing something and seeing what we *expect* to see.

Importance of asking counterfactual questions. "What if...?"

Problems are much more often solved by reframing them in a way that can be attacked with a known approach, than via a completely new approach.

### Freedom in constraints

Standardization and restrictions make things easier, as there is less stuff getting in the way. There is a "paradox of choice". Not having to make choices can unleash a lot of potential. The lack of structure and restrictions is a threat to creativity.

We are more likely to lose motivation if we embark in a big project with a masterplan but a lot of uncertainty on how it will develop. If we start from a solid base of already interconnected ideas, the probability is lower.

It is easier to stay motivated about something we can visualize in our mind than about something we have a hard time imagining.

### Creativity and familiarity

Deep familiarity with a topic is what gives the freedom to experiment, break the rules, and try something new. When you are still "intimidated" by a topic, you don't dare anything crazy.

The discovery of the structure of DNA as an example of "change of direction" that led to a much bigger discovery. Delicate point here: how to strike the right balance between changing direction at the right time as opposed to doing it so often that you end up in the "Brownian motion regime".

To think about: Luhmann's "When I am stuck for a moment I do something else". Is this applicable to the work environment as well?
